<p align="justify"> My name is Shreshthangshu Chanda or ShreshChanda. I am a highschool student in Bangladesh. I am a teenager who's interested in computer science ,programming, game development and cybersecurity.
I have been learning Python, Html and Gdscript for programming softwares, websites and games. I also learnt hacking in linux.
I use WindowsOS primarily because it is good, but I also use Linux using WSL(Windows for Subsystem Linux). I use the Kali-linux distro.
I learnt all of this things from online sources such as Youtube etc. I am self taught.
